# calculator

A calculator made with Javascript, HTML and CSS. First major project completed by me (John K) in early 2022. The code is not perfect however I am intentionally leaving most of the code untouched for the sake of posterity. I am well aware it is not perfect but I would like to preserve this as a sort of personal time capsule, so that in the future I can come back and visit and laugh at how foolishly I used to write code.
